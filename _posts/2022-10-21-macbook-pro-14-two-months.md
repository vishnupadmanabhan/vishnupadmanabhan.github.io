I have been using the MacBook Pro 14' with the M1 Pro chip for just over two months now and I am absolutely blown away by it!

I upgraded from a 2019 MacBook Pro 13' back in August. Yes, by the time I got mine, the 14' MacBook was in the market for over 10 months. But by no means is it outdated.

My use over the past two months have been mostly personal and for my side projects that involves some amount of video and audio work. Add to that a bit of photo manipulation and writing, it pretty much sums up my use case.

My initial plan was to go with the M2 MacBook Air, maybe in Midnight colour. But instead I got myself this beast. The MacBook Air is also a very capable machine. My favourite reviewer, [Mark Ellis](https://www.youtube.com/c/MarkEllisReviews) is an absolute fan of the Air and currently runs his business on it. Using Pro for video editing. 

Lets discuss some of the things that I have really liked about the MacBook Pro.

### Battery
I do work from cafes often and one of the concerns I had earlier was to secure a chanrging point and carrying around my charger during my cafe stints. But ever since I have got my MacBook Pro 14', I have never have to look around for a charer.

The battery life in this laptop is just mind blowing. After a good morning stint at a cafe for two to three hours, I still see the batter sitting around higher side of 80s.

Generally MacBooks have good batteries, but this to me is a big win upgrade.

### The Screen
Oh my, that berautiful screen. I have been using my Macs most of the time at home connected to an average external display with the MacBook in clamshell mode.

But after I got this one, I see myself working more on the laptop without it being connected to the external display because the display on this thing is absolutely gorgeous!

HDR content looks absolutely stunning and the colours on videos and images look brilliant. 

### Keyboard
One other thing that supplements my love of using the MacBook in 'laptop' mode is its excellent keyboard. I generally use an external mechanical keyboard, the Keychron K6, when using my computer in the 'desktop' mode. 

But the keyboard on these Macs are absolute delight to type on. I love the overall black keyboard layout which you do not currently get on the Airs. It is lovely, both to look at and touch.

They have good key travel and feel and is very much an upgrade over the keyboard of my 2019 MacBook Pro which has one of the not so great keyboards I have used.

### More Ports & Magsafe
When Apple decided to cut down on the ports on its pro model of MacBooks, I wasn't very much worried and use to thing that dongles and docks could always solve this issue.

But when I started using this machine with all its ports and Masafe charging port, I realised that the convinience is not tradeable. It is absolutely a pleasure to have all the ports within the machine.

Having the SD card slot makes it so much easier to copy photos and videos on to the Mac.

### The Extras
There are many other things that I absolutely love about the MacBook Pro, but they are so much a character of the machine that they tend to be invisible.

The processing speed, the aesthetics and the fact that you can carry around a machine of this prowess in a backpack is really mind boggling to me.

I can say this confidence, if you buy this machine, it will put a smile on your face and it will keep that smile on your face everytime you take this out to work!

There will be more MacBook Pros in the future, but this one definitely is a turning point as well as a head turner.
