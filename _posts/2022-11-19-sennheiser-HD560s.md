I've been an audiphile all of my life, well most of it since the time I remember. Grew up listening to old cassette tapes and I remember being fascinated by the stereo sound of the player. 

Both channels playing different sounds and vocals coming from the center where there was no speaker was all fascinating stuff for me.

Fast forward many years and I am now fortunate enough to be in a position to be able to buy devices that let me enjoy music more than ever and thanks to streaming gods, I have access to any music at any time I wish.
