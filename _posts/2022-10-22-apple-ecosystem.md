I just realised that I am so deep into the Apple ecosystem that I have technically become an 'Apple Consultant' within my family and friend's circle.

One might say that I am an Apple Fanboy, but there are geniune deep rooted reason for Apple products being an important part of my personal life and running most of the aspects of it.

From the day I can remember that I got into tech, would've been sometime in college, when I started hearing about Apple products, mostly through the internet.

They were pretty and they were functional. I started with an iPod shuffle which at the time felt a little restrictive since you needed iTunes to sync your playlists and copy files into the player. Traditional players allowed you to just do a simple copy paste of the files into the player.

But I loved it! It definitely got a lot of eyeballs back in college because an Apple product was not very common in India at the time and it defiitely made me feel better about myself. It was this tiny little beautiful player with very minimal control surfeces and switches.

But as time moved on, I realised that Apple devices were not just pretty status symbols. They are really functional and excellently made products.

I got my first MacBook which was a MacBook Air 13 inch, the Intel version that is. My wife still uses it and it is an absolutely wonderful machine. I love the form factor, keyboard and everything about that Air and is to date one of my favourite computer.

I was into a bit of web development, writing, podcasting and bit of video editing at this point and for my needs, MacBook Air was an allrounder machine. I was amazed at the way this Mac handled all the work while being tiny and cute.

These products were costlier than the other products in the market, but they were much worth the price.

### 1. The Software
MacBooks and Macs in general have a great reputation for shipping with brilliant shoftware that is in harmony with the hardware. Apple builds their own operating system for all their products and that definitely gives them an advantage over the laptops that ship with generic operating systems.

I have been using MacOS for years now and I can probably count on my fingers on one hand the number of times it has crashed or hung up. It is absolutely stable. 

It is fast. You can just close the lid of your MacBook after a long day of work without quitting your apps and all you need to do it open the lid and log back in to resume your work where you left off.

This also applies to the software that are made for MacOS specifically. I have rarely had issues with any of them and they work seamlessly. I don't know what it is, but software made for MacOS all have a sort of "finess" to them.

### 2. The Integration
Apple product play well with each other. When you use different Apple products, they don't feel like different products, but instead feel like different extensions of the same product. 

Agreed that these days there are products and companies that are trying to replicate this within their set of products. But I am yet to find a company that does it so well.

Everything syncs across the devices, everything connects instantly, you can leave it on and pick up on the other and so on. This seamlessness is more than enough for me to pay a premium to buy them. The value it adds to my life is worth the cost.

### 3. Apple's Stance on Privacy
Apple has been pretty vocal about their stance on privacy. It is up for debate how much they do to safeguard their customers' data, but I am yet to see another consumer tech company come forward and put their foot down about this.

While I am sure that already data that can be traced back to me is floating around somewhere along the dark streets of internet and there are vultures trying to figure out how to make dark use of it, I feel at ease that the company that makes the products that I use to run my life care about privacy. Makes a difference to me.

### 4. Longevity
When I was at the store purchasing my MacBook Pro 14' on which I am currently wrting this article sitting in a cafe, the sales agent pulled up a ten year old MacBook Air 11' for billing the product. 

When I enquired, he mentioned that it worked well for their needs. That is just midblowing. In a world of tech where it takes just months or even weeks for a product to be considered outdated, being able to use a computer for longer period of time, in most cases with software support, is just astounding.

Recently there was a security update that was rolled out by Apple for iOS 12. Current version of iOS as I write this article is 16 and 12 was released back in 2018. To think that they Apple cared to release an update for a our year old mobile OS says something about them.

### Epilogue
This is not to say that there are no issues with Apple products. There definitely are, like any other product from any other company. But these are things that make these products a little more dearer to me than their counterparts.

For a foreseeable future, I see myself using Apple products while occassionaly trying out tech from other manufacturers. I am very happy being in the ecosystem.
