Apple released the latest version of MacOS - Ventura a few hours ago and I upgraded my MacBook. I have some thoughts on the first impressions with the upgrade.

### 1. Stability
I had tried Ventura a few weeks ago for couple of days when it was still in beta. In my years of testing beta versions of MacOS, none of the previous versions had given me as much trouble as Ventura beta.

It was so glitchy for me that I had to do a system restore and go back to Montery. It used to completely freeze up and I had to hard restart my Mac.

With this experience, I was not very keen on upgrading and was skeptical. But I am pleased to say that so far it has been smooth sailing. The OS is stable and snappy. No degradation in performance or any heating issues.

### 2. Stage Manager
It sounds funny, but one of the reasons I was eager to try Ventura was the infamous 'Stage Manager'. This to me is a nice little feature because when I moved from Windows to Mac, one of the things that confused me was the way MacOS managed windows when they were minimised.

Stage manager sort of solves that issue and lets one see how many windows are open at a given time. Although this was a feature which was expected to give a window manager feel to iPad OS, but I feel that stage manager is great for MacOS as well.

It is a good start to a new way of managing windows and I would love to see how it eveolves in later versions of MacOS and what more we might see appended to the functional aspects of stage manager.

For now, I am using stage manager when connected to my external monitor and am finding it useful. If the novelty wears away, I shall update in a future article.

### 3. Convergent System Settings
System Preferences in Ventura has been rechristened as 'System Settings' and given a UI overhaul. It is now similar to the iOS and iPad OS UI.

I have mixed feelings about it which I attribute to the unfamiliarity due to just few hours of use. This is something I want to evaluate in long term. But for now, I do not have anything negative as such and the UI convergence between the device platforms might actually be a good thing.

### 4. Spotlight on Steroids
Alfred is an app that I have been using a lot over the past few years to become a productivity monster üòù. It had made it qicker to search and open apps.

But with the release of Ventura, I am giving Spotlight a try since this time, it is on steroids. I am loving it too!

### 5. Continuity Camera
This is another feature that I think is going to be very useful, especially for people who are in meetings or video calls a lot. 

Apple has some of the best hardware available in the market and even though the camera on Mac was recently upgraded to a 1080p camra, it is still subpar when it comes to an iPhone camera.

The continuity camera feature allows  the use of iPhone camera as a webcam for video calling. The result is great quality along with portrait mode etc available to be used on the desktop.

### 6. Weather and Clock
Finally we have the weather and clock apps on the desktop with Ventura. It might or might not be of significance, but it is nice to see native apps built into the MacOS for weather and clock.

If you work across time zones, having the visibility on the desktop might be a great thing, I might end up using the clock more often than I think.

### Conclusion
Overall, this is an update with great new features. Especially for someone who spends time on video calls and conferences, haviong access to better video quality via continuity camera might be a massive advantage.

Again, it is a personal preference and this seems to be a good direction that the OS is heading to. I would definitely recommend an upgrade.
