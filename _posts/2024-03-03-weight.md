I few years ago, I had written about '[Why you aren't losing weight](https://medium.com/meltingsnowflake/why-you-arent-losing-weight-5576454e9215)'. Incidently past six years have been the clear case of one not following their ow advice. I have been on a roller coaster ride with respect to my health and past year has been one of the lowest point.

I was overweight for quite some time, struggled to lose weight. In fact there was no motivation to put effort into losing weight. No food restrictions, eating at odd hours, considering food to be the comforting thing one does when bored. All this reaulted in measurements going out of normal. Certain components in blood started going off the nominal upper limits.

Over a weekend, soemthing changed. I decided I did not want to feel unhealthy. I did not want to feel lethargic, weak, look way above my age etc. I did not want to do drastic thing which are not mainetinable in the long run, so I started by making three small changes - 
- Walk more
- Eat less
- Cut sugar off

I said *small* changes, but these were by no means easy changes.
