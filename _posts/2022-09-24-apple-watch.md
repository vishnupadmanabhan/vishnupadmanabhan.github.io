A friend of mine recently reached out to me to ask if it is worth investing in an Apple Watch. What followed was a conversation trying to convince him that it is worth an investment and I ended it by saying that Apple Watch changed my attitude towards my health.

But my association did not start with excitement for the Apple Watch. It was one of the Apple devices that I was skeptical since the launch. 

It sounded gimmicky to me. It might have been my lack of trust on Apple at that point but for some reason, I failed to understand why one would need an expensive watch to track some of the stuff that cheaper wrist trackers couldn’t do.

I held off buying an Apple Watch until last year. It was on sale and I had heard of stories where Apple Watch had come handy in alerting users of change in heart conditions and decided to give it a try.

Got myself an Apple Watch SE which I felt had was functional enough for my uses. It changed few things - 

### Health
Ever since I strapped that Apple Watch on my wrist, I started understanding why it mattered the hype.

I was able to measure certain metrics which traditional fitness trackers did not provide. This pushed me in the general direction of caring a little more about my health and having a way to measure my progress.

“Closing the rings” became something that I aimed to do at least 4-5 times a week. Doing it without breaking the chain for a whole month etc was beyond my commitment, but at least making sure that I move around a bit during the day was a bit of a relief.

My career choice puts me stationary on a chair for hours at end and watch lets me know when I need to take a break and stand up and walk around. 

Sleep tracking is something that has been enhanced with the latest WatchOS 9 and gives you a deeper understanding of your sleep patterns. I have had a very irregular sleep pattern and the sleep tracking keeps me in check and gives me data to figure out the scope for improvement.

### Connected devices
Apple Watch has a tight integration with iPhone and MacBook, both of which I use on a daily basis. 

I occasionally use my MacBook in ‘clamshell’ mode while being connected to an external monitor. In this mode, I would not be able to access Touch ID  for unlocking the Mac. I love the ‘unlock with Apple Watch’ feature that comes really handy in these situations.

With this feature, Mac detects the Apple Watch that is nearby which belongs to the owner and as long as the watch is unlocked, it unlocks the Mac as well. Pure gold.

Apple Watch also notifies when you are getting a call and you have your iPhone at your desk or someplace else. You can even take the call through your watch with reasonable clarity. If you have a cellular one, you can leave the house without your phone and still be able to make calls and send messages.

Another feature that I find myself using a lot is to be able to control audio through ‘now playing’ feature. This provides controls on the watch to play, pause, volume control etc on the watch while you are listening to audio. While on a walk or a jog, you don’t have to pull out your phone to control audio. 

Especially useful if your earphones or headphones don’t have these features. I use a verity of headphones and IEMs, so this feature comes handy more than once in a day.

### Alarm
There are many occasions where I might’ve had to wake up at a particular time in the morning without bothering my wife. Traditional phone alarms wake up everyone in the room. But Apple Watch’s ‘silent alarm’ or so I call it, is really helpful. When the alarm goes off, watch vibrates on your wrist, gently waking you up.

This is an absolute game changer for me.

### Easy access
Watch also provides easy access to some of the features like navigation, voice memo and Siri. These are some of the features that are useful especially if you are driving or riding and pulling out your phone isn’t a viable option.

Watch also has a loudness indicator that notifies when there the noise levels exceed the permissible levels for human ears. More than once I have been able to avoid extra loud sounds due to this. I also started using earplugs while riding since the noise levels consistently hit above 90 dBs during weekend rides.

### Durability
On the outside, it might seem that these watches are fragile piece of tech and I was very concerned during the initial days about scratching it or breaking it. I used a case for a long time, but the case took away the beauty of the watch and now I use them case free.

I have hit my watch on walls, tables, counters and every other place you can think of. Except for a small scratch on the screen which happened when I hit it really hard, there is not one scratch or scuff. This is the aluminium version and still holds up well. Stainless steel would be even more durable.

They are well built and can be used without the anxiety of one damaging them.

### Conclusion
Everything said and done, Apple Watch has definitely made my life easier and made me bit more conscious about how much I move around during the day. It has lot more features than I put to use and I am no Apple Watch power user. But for the price I have paid for them, they have more than made my life better.

If you are in the Apple ecosystem, getting an Apple Watch is a no brainer. If you are not, it is definitely worth giving a try and I can tell you, you will not be disappointed.
