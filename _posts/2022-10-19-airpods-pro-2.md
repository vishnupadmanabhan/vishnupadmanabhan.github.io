When AirPods launched back in 2016, I was on the side of the group which thought that it was a bad idea. I wasn't sure how a totally wireless earbuds could serve my purpose. Also it felt absurd that this product should exist given that it was weird. Yes, I did think that.

Fast forward to 2020, mid of the year the pandemic stuck. I was getting into more audio stuff. The first product I remember purchasing was a pair of true wireless earbuds called the RHA TrueConnect, a really awesome looking pair of earbuds.

Sadly, it had some issues with audio syncing etc and I kinda lost my faith in truely wireless earbuds. But after trying few other brands, I was convinced by the sheer convinience of it.

I love audio and music and have used wired earphones or headphones for all my music listening all the while.

When the all new AirPods Pro came in last week and the reviews mentioned a much imporved audio quality, I felt I need to get my hands on it.

I did and boy was it a pleasant surprise!

I have been using TWS earbuds for quite some time mostly for listening to audiobooks, podcasts and occassional casual music listening. I have never felt satisfied lisgtening to music because most of them weren't really good.

But for the fisrt time I see myself listening to music more through the convinience of wireless than using my traditional amp-dac setup with my wired headphones. That goes enough to say that AirPods Pro second gen are an absolute improvement over anything I have ever used to lisnten to music wirelessly.

Of course, that claim is limited by my accessibility to a wide veriety of true wireless buds, but it is good enough to make me listen to music more without my wired setup.

## Things I am not a fan of
One of the major issues I have felt about AirPods Pro 2 is that they are so smooth that sometimes they do jump out of my hands and go running across the floor. 

I do not like dropping my electronic stuff and this makes me real sad. I wish they had more of matte finish which would've provided more grip to hold on to the buds themselves.

I have got myself an armour case for the case, which keeps it very safe against falls and drops. But nothing to prevent the pods themselves from slipping and then jumping across the floor.

Being white in colour, they are very much prone to dirt and dust being visible on them. After a good day's use, I end up cleaning them every night. 

This is something that I am not a fan of. With my other TWS earbuds, I seldom face this issue because they come in colours other than white. 

The day Apple decides to release a black or grey version of AirPods Pro, I am giving them my money!

These are some of the issues I can easily turn my back on and ignore. I love absolutely everything else about these AirPods and will be using them for a long time for a foreseeable future.
