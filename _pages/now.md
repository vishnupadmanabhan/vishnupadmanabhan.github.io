This is my '[now page](https://nownownow.com/about){:target="_blank"}' udpated from Bangalore, India on 19th March 2024.

### What I am working on

I have always tried to keep up with technology and learn something new in programming at least every two to three years. Currently I am trying to learn a Vue js framework called [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/){:target="_blank"}. I am currently building a couple of side projects for my personal learning to understand the tech.

### Blog
It is been a while since I have written anything meaningful on the blog here. So I am currenly focusing on getting a few articles written to be published on this blog. There are few topics I have in mind that I am drafting articles on. My plan is to start publishing in April as these are some busy days at my day job.

### Coffee
I am currently finding out new recipes using instant coffee (blasphemy, I know!) that I can make for the days I am working from home. We have a hybrid work policy, so I spend a couple of my workdays at home. A homemade coffee that feels like a coffee shop coffee makes me feel good!

### Another Podcast?
My brother and I used to host a podcast which has been on a hiatus for about a year now. I have an idea that I am evaluating for a solo podcast and is in research phase. If it makes any progress in the next six months, you'dread about it here.
